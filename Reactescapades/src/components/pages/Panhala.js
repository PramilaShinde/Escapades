                        Panahala fort was built between 1178 and 1209 CE, one of 15 forts (others including Bavda, 
                        Bhudargad,Satara, and Vishalgad) built by the Shilahara ruler Bhoja II. It is said that 
                        aphorism Kahaan Raja Bhoj,kahan Gangu Teli is associated with this fort. A copper plate found 
                        in Satara shows that Raja Bhoja held court at Panhala from 1191–1192 CE. About 1209–10, 
                        Bhoja Raja was defeated by Singhana (1209–1247),the most powerful of the Devgiri Yadavas, and 
                        the fort subsequently passed into the hands of the Yadavas.Apparently it was not well looked 
                        after and it passed through several local chiefs. In 1376 inscriptions record the settlement of 
                        Nabhapur to the south-east of the fort.It was an outpost of the Bahamanis of Bidar. Mahmud Gawan,
                        an influential prime minister, encamped here during the rainy season of 1469. On the 
                        establishment of the Adil Shahi dynasty of Bijapur in 1489, Panhala came under Bijapur and was 
                        fortified extensively. They built the strong ramparts and gateways of the fort which, according
                        to tradition, took a hundred years to build. Numerous inscriptions in the fort refer to the 
                        reign of Ibrahim Adil Shah, probably Ibrahim.
