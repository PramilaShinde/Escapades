                        Visapur fort is a hill fort built by Balaji Vishwanath during 1713-1720 CE.Balaji Vishwanath was
                        first Peshwa of Maratha empire. Though Visapur fort is built much later than Lohagad fort,the 
                        two forts are closely linked as Visapur fort is fortified for protecting Lohagad fort.Both these
                        forts are of Satwahan Era. Too keep watch on Konkan and Bor Ghat, these both forts were of great 
                        importance during Shivaji's period.It is believed that probably it was taken as bounty from an 
                        English ship and presented to the Peshwa by Kanhoji Angre.This fort has Hanuman carvings that 
                        show the patron deity of the empire at that era.But unfortunately, demolished in 1818. At those 
                        times these forts and nearby villages invaded by the enemies so as to extend their empire.The 
                        Visapur fort was built with the purpose to protect the Lohagad fort. The Lohagad fort was ruled 
                        by various dynasties like Satavahanas, Chalukyas, Rashtrakutas, Yadavs, Bahmanis, Nizams, Mughals 
                        and Marathas.Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj captured The Lohagad fort in 1648AD. But soon as per 
                        the Treaty of Purandar he had to give it to the Mughals. But Shivaji Maharaj again recaptured 
                        it in 1665 AD. And afterwards,it was used to keep the treasury. For a long time, the Marathas 
                        ruled it.
