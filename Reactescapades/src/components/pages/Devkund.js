                        Devkund waterfall is a secluded little place situated deep inside the forests surrounding Bhira 
                        dam.There is a hydroelectric power generation unit by Tata power at Bhira. This place was 
                        little known to trekkers till recent times and has come into limelight due to the waterfall 
                        present deep inside the forest.It is believed that Kundalika river originates at Devkund.Though
                        there isn’t much history associated with the falls, locals here believe that once upon a time 
                        utensils used to emerge from the kund (pond) whenever there was any auspicious ceremony happening in the local village.
                        True or not, the place has its own charm with the water dropping from a height of over 80 ft straight into a 
                        pond of approx. 30 mt diameter.Locals have marked a line of control bisecting the pond. 
                        Swimming in the first half of the bisection is allowed.No one is allowed to go to the point 
                        where the water hits the ground as the depth over there is around 60 feet and there have been 
                        incidences of visitors drowning in it.

                        the Sahyadri ranges in Maharashtra. Tamhini Ghat is famous for its alluring landscape filled with 
                        sprawling valleys dense forests, and some of the prettiest waterfalls, riverbeds, and lakes.

                        base village is about 7 hours long from Mumbai and 5 hours long from Pune. It can be easily

                        with a strong gush on the rocky surface right into a natural pool of turquoise waters.The 
                        fresh waterfall flows throughout the year, making it one of the few perennial waterfalls in
