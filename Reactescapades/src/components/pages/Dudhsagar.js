                        There has been a lot of hype of Dudhsagar trek being closed for the general
                        public.The Dudhsagar railway trek has been officially closed for the 
                        general public but the trek to the Dudhsagar falls bottom is still open 
                        for all.There are two routes to reach there.One is starting the trek from 
                        Kulem and follow the jeep trail until the bottom of the waterfall.The 
                        second option is via the railway track which is roughly around 11 km. You can trek up to 
                        the Sonaulim station and join back to the Mud route. This route would save 
                        2 km on the Mud road.During the monsoon season, it is mandatory to hire a 
                        guide and get a life jacket in order to start the trek otherwise the entry 
                        inside the forest is restricted because the area experiences extremely heavy
                        rainfall and the water displacement around the fall are potentially very 
                        large, so it is always better to carry a life jacket.
