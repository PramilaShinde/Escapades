                        The origin of this fort is said to date back to the 2nd century the same age as the Thanale 
                        Caves and Khadsamble caves nearby. It was then called Bhrorapgad (after its presiding deity, 
                        Bhoraidevi). In 1436, it was captured by the Bahamani Sultan. In 1657,the Marathas took over 
                        and renamed it "Sudhagad"(the sweet one). It was a large fort and Sudhagad was considered by 
                        Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj as the capital of his kingdom. He surveyed it, but instead chose 
                        Raigad because of its central location.In the regime of the Peshwas, the ‘Pantsachivas’ of Bhor 
                        became the custodians of this fort.After the annexation of princely states in 1950 the fort 
                        became patron less. As a result, the fort is in a state of ruins, even though it escaped the 
                        wrath of the British.

                        One has to head towards Khopoli which is a bit ahead of Lonavala. From Khopoli you can ask the 
                        locals for directions to Pali or use google maps to get there.There are 2 base villages from 
                        where you can start the actual trek. One is via Pacchapur(Thakurwadi) village and the other is 
                        via Dhondse village. During all our trips, we've gone via the Thakurwadi route which is said to 
                        be relatively easy than the Dhonse route. Thakurwadi is around 12 kilometres from Pali.If you 
                        are a beginner you can always hire a guide from the base village to help you with the trek route.
