                                        The fort is quite ancient. Remnants of Microlithic man have been discovered here. The various 
                                        Puranas (ancient scriptures) like Matsyapurana, Agnipurana and Skandapurana include many references 
                                        bout Harishchandragad. Its origin is said to have been in the 6th century, during the rule of 
                                        Kalachuri dynasty. The citadel was built during this era. The various caves probably have been carved
                                        out in the 11th century. In these caves are idols of Lord Vishnu. Though the cliffs are named 
                                        Taramati and Rohidas, they are not related to Ayodhya. Great sage Changdev (one who created the epic 
                                        atvasaar), used to meditate here in the 14th century. The caves are from the same period. 
                                        The various constructions on the fort and those existing the surrounding region point to the 
                                        existence of diverse cultures here. The carvings on the temples of Nageshwar (in Khireshwar village),
                                        in the Harishchandreshwar temple and in the cave of Kedareshwar indicate that the fort belongs to 
                                        the medieval period, since it is related to mahadeva as a totem of tribes Mahadev Koli. They were 
                                        controlling the fort before Moguls. Later the fort was under the control of Moguls. The Marathas 
                                        captured it in 1747.
